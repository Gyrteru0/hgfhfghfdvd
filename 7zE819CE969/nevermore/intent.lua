-- The bot's intent for the tick: a finite state machine with hysteresis (minimum time in a state +
-- different enter/exit thresholds) so it does not flip between modes every frame.
--
-- States (by priority):
-- RETREAT - the enemy can kill me with his available burst and I cannot kill him "right now";
-- ALLIN   - I kill him with my available burst (and can reach him);
-- ZONE    - I am stronger in absolute HP and the enemy is at my wave: keep him off the creeps;
-- TRADE   - the trade is favourable/even and the enemy is in reach: pressure with razes/clicks;
-- PUSH    - the enemy is dead/unseen for >5 s, or a large advantage: push the wave, hit the T1 under a shield;
-- FARM    - default: last hits/denies.
